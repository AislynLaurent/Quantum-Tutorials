# Resources

Here I've compiled all the important links from throughout the tutorial. If you're looking for something I've mentioned, you should be able to find it here.

## General Resources

### Khan Academy

In each section of this tutorial, I'll link to problem sets and detailed explainations on Khan Academy for those who require additional review material.

You can find a complete list of all the additional review material in the summary for each section.

## Tools

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)

All of the development tutorials on this website will be based on python. If you need to learn more about python, you can head to the [python beginners guide](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) for more information.

There are a bunch of [python tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) to help you get started. The University of Windsor also offers a python course.

### [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

In order to continue with these tutorials you must install Anadconda - a python distribution specifically designed for data science. You can jump right into it and [download Anaconda here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

_Make sure that you download the 3.7 version_, as all the tutorials here will be based on that.

You can find an [Anaconda installation guide here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk).

### [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html)

I will use Jupyter Notebooks occasionally, and you may like to as well. They're especially handy because they _come installed with Anaconda_.

You can fine [more information about Jupyter here](https://jupyter.org/documentation).

### [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)

This website will use the Qiskit programming library - a python library developed by IBM for use on their quantum systems. The [Qiskit YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/Qiskit) is a resource for anyone getting started. They have a bunch of helpful tutorials there for you to watch if you'd like to.

The [Qiskit installation guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#access-ibm-q-systems%20) is good for users already comfortable with python. You can also find [a video tutorial for how to install Qiskit here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4EkW4VwhcI). There are also tutorials for getting started programming there.

There are also other Qiskit resources available, like...

* The [Qiskit Slack workspace](https://qiskit.slack.com/)
* Qiskit on the [quantum computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qiskit)
* [Medium articles on Qiskit](https://medium.com/qiskit)

### [IBMQ](https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/)

You can run your quantum code on IBM's system. In order to do that, you'll need an [IBMQ account](https://qiskit.org/ibmqaccount).

[Setup your IBM Quantum Experience account here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login). Once you've done that, you'll get access to an API token - don't worry, you'll be prompted on how to find it during the tutorial.

## Understanding Quantum

I'll be going through the basics on Quantum here on with website, but if you're looking for more, try these:
