# Project Scope and Purpose

Recently, IBM made their quantum system available for use by both businesses and educators. This means that students and professionals alike will have the opportunity to explore - to test what is possible and learn how to develop for it.

This is of particular interest to me, as I do research in computational chemistry and have been looking forward to the possibility of using quantum computers to solve larger and more complex chemical problems. As part of my capstone project I've decided learn more about quantum computing. This includes, but is not limited to, relevant reading and research, interviews with professionals, and attempting to develop software for the system.

Part of what I plan to do is create tutorials for others hoping to use this technology, along with some example projects. Ultimately the plan is for this to become a resource for anyone interested in quantum computers.
