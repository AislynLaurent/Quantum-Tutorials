# Qubits Summary

## New Types of Computation

This guide is intended for those who already have a strong foundational understanding of computer systems and how they work. As such we'll start our discussion of quantum bits with just a very brief review of classical bits and how they work.

Quantum bits take advantage of the property of superposition to contain multiple pieces of information at the same time. This is a little weird when you first get into it, but overall is very interesting.

## Material

In this section we'll cover classical bits, classical registers, quantum bits and the Bloch sphere:
