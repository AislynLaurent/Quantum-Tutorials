# Installing Qiskit

## What is Qiskit

Qiskit is a python library prepared for people who would like to work on quantum systems. It's a great way to integrate quantum solutions into your own work. You can use other python libraries along side it to enhance the work you do with it. Some recommended libraries would be:

* \_\_[_MatPlotLib_ ](https://matplotlib.org/)- Great for visualizing results and making graphs
* \_\_[_Numpy_ ](https://numpy.org/)- A math library that includes all kinds of useful functions for preforming complex equations and operations
* \_\_[_Pandas_ ](https://pandas.pydata.org/)-  A data structure library designed to make importing and handling data \(especially large sets\) easier

## What You Need

We mentioned at the beginning of this guide, I'll assume you know a little python already. Python is super easy to learn and is very intuitive, especially if you already know another object oriented language like Java. You can find more __[_information about learning python_](../getting-started/resources.md#python) in the [_resources_](../getting-started/resources.md) section.

 and that you have python installed on your computer. 

You may also want to use an IDE, like Visual Studio Code or something similar. That's up to you - technically all this work can be done in a simple text editor, but al IDE makes for a nice experience. If you prefer simple text editors, I highly recommend Notepad++ - it's an excellent option.
