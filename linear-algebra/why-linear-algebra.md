# Why Linear Algebra

## The language of Quantum Mechanics

While we describe physical systems in a bunch of different ways, linear algebra is the best way to describe the behaviour of quantum objects. It also just happens to be the most convenient way to translate the theory behind whats going on into practical protocols for developing quantum algorithms.

In this section we'll review a few key concepts, as well as introduce new ideas you may not be familiar with:

* Bra-ket Notation
* Linear Combinations
* Linear Independence / Dependence
* Linear Transformations
* Basis and Span
* Inner Product

And a few others.
