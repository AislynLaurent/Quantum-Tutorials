# Why Linear Algebra

## The language of Quantum Mechanics

While we describe physical systems in a bunch of different ways, linear algebra is the best way to describe the behaviour of quantum objects. It's also the best way to translate the theory behind whats going on into practical protocols for developing quantum algorithms.

### Material

The purpose of this section is to touch on each of the most important topics in linear algebra, without going into too much detail. If you're reading through and find yourself unfamiliar with a particular topic, you'd benefit from taking some time to review it.
