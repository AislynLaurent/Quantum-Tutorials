# Why Linear Algebra

## The language of Quantum Mechanics

While we describe physical systems in a bunch of different ways, linear algebra is the best way to describe the behaviour of quantum objects. It's also the best way to translate the theory behind whats going on into practical protocols for developing quantum algorithms.

### Material

The purpose of this section is to touch on each of the most important topics in linear algebra, without going into too much detail. If you're reading through and find yourself unfamiliar with a particular topic, you'd benefit from taking some time to review it.

### Review Material

* Vectors
* Matrix operations
* Linear combinations
* Linear independence / dependence
* Linear transformations
* Vector spaces
* Basis and span
* Normalization
* Projection

### New Material

* Bra-ket notation

## Resources

### Khan Academy

In each sub-section of this section of the tutorial, we'll link to problem sets on Khan Academy for those who require additional review material.

If you haven't had the chance to take all the relevant courses, going through the entire [Khan Academy Linear Algebra course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) would be a good idea.
