# Transformations

## Inner Product

The _dot product_ of two vectors is a special case of the _inner product_, where everything lines up nicely 

## Transformations

We can transform a vector to change it into another vector. In general, this vector can be in the same or in a different "vector space" - for example, a vector along one plane could transform into a vector along another plane. 

### Notation

Transformations are described using a matrix, labeled with a letter wearing a little hat - like this: $$\hat{T}$$. To apply the transformation, we multiply the vector by the transformation matrix.

So, the expression...

$$
\hat{T}|x\rangle = |y\rangle
$$

...describes $$|y\rangle$$, which is a result of $$|x\rangle$$transformed by $$\hat{T}$$. We'll discuss transformations in more detail later on.
