# Using Quantum Gates - The Circuit Composer

## How to Use the Circuit Composer

The circuit composer is a very intuitive tool. You start out looking at a summary of all your circuits with some basic information about them listed.

### Creating a new circuit

You start by selecting the new circuit button:

You'll then be taken into the tool itself.

On the left-hand side you can see a few different options. The first just displays some general information as above.

The second lets you tweak your circuit, including the number of quantum registers \(each of which holds one qubit\) and the number of classical registers \(which is where results will be stored before they're ready and displayed\).
