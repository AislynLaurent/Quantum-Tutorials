# IBMQ Tools

## Summary of the Tools

IBM has prepared several useful tools, guides and resources for you. We'll go over them one by one here before getting into the circuit composer in detail.

### Dashboard

When you first log in, you'll be looking at your dashboard.

Here you'll find a summary of your results, along with a list of quantum systems that you have access to and their current workload. If you haven't done any work, you won't have any results, so there won't be much to see yet.

### Results

Here you'll see an overview of your results once you have some.

### Circuit Composer

The circuit composer lets you construct your own circuit. It includes an excellent glossary of all the different gates with short descriptions of what they do and the same nice animations from [_earlier in this tutorial_](../quantum-circuits/single-qubit-gates.md). We'll be using it in the next section to put together some simple circuits.

### Qiskit Notebooks

On this page you can look through existing, and create your own, jupyter notebooks with qiskit installed and ready to go. It's a really handy way to run a bit of qiskit code and test things out. We'll use this a bit later on in the tutorial as well.

### Resources

The resources page includes all the information you'll need to get started along with some more advanced stuff. It's the same thing you'll see if you go to the getting started guide when you sign in.

### Support

If you need somewhere to ask a specific question, or if you just want to stay in the loop, the support page offers a number of options for you. I highly recommend joining to qiskit slack channel - it's a great way to keep an eye on whats new or to get some one on one help.
