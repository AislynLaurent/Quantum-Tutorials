# IBMQ Summary

## Overview

The IBM Quantum Experience is the tool we'll be using to actually work on real quantum systems. IBM has done a fantastic job of making their systems available to everyone interested in working on them. Everything is very intuitive, and it's a great place to start if you'd just like to mess around and try things out.
