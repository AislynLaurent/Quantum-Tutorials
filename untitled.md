# Quantum Safe Algorithms

## Discussion with Paul Lucier

### History of Isara Corporation

Isara began 5 years ago as a small company of about 35 people from across Waterloo, which is know as a hub for new technology and in particular quantum computing. The group consited of experts and recent PhD graduates who all shared the same enuthisam for quantum technology.

At the time quatum computing was still in it's infancy, but those industry leaders who understood cyber security and ethics had growing concern. The strength of quantum systems remains primarily in solving large mathmatical problems. This is an exciting possibility - problems that may have taken until the heat-death of the universe on a classical system might finally be considered solvable. The concern comes when these machines are turned toward our strongest encryption algothims.

### The need to for caution

As the enthuisatic push toward quantum systems continued, Paul Luicer, Vice president of sales at Isara Corporation \(a company working to integrate quantum safe technology\), describes interactions with high up officials:

"Governments come to us and ask _'How do I use this exciting new technology? What can quantum do for us?'_, and I have to turn around and say - wait a minute. Before you start talking about what quantum can do for you, you need to start thinking about how you can protect yourself!"
