# Quantum Mechanics

If you've read this document so far in one sitting, I'll commend you for that. I hope you've felt like it was informative. However... if you haven't yet, this is the moment to take a break. Have some tea, and make sure you've been able to follow along so far. Things are about to get _weird_.

Whereas classical mechanics tells us about medium size stuff \(so just about 100% of the things we interact with\), quantum mechanics deal with the tiniest stuff. The models used are much more complex, because stuff that small is very unpredictable.

You couldn't describe medium sized stuff with the same rules that you describe quantum sized stuff, simply because they don't behave in the same ways.

## Quantum Systems

### N-Dimensional Space

Previously, we were talking a mass \(an object\) in a 3-Dimensional space. 

When we talk about quantum systems, we're instead talking about a _particle_ \(an object with very little mass\) in an $$N$$-Dimensional space. That is to say, in a space without a defined number of dimensions. Which is to say, described by [_vectors_ ](../linear-algebra/vectors.md#vectors)with an undefined number of [_elements_](../linear-algebra/vectors.md#column-vectors).

This is because we can collect more _information_ about these particles than
