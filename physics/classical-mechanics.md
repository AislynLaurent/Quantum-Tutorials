# Classical Mechanics

## Position

We start with a static object at a given position. We know _exactly_ where this object is, because we can go ahead and measured it directly.

For this example we'll imagine the position of our object as existing on an $$x, y$$ plane, where $$y$$ is the objects location, and $$x$$ is the _time_ that we measured it. This idea of time is important, because of course we live in real life, and so any given thing only exists in any given position for a finite amount of time.
