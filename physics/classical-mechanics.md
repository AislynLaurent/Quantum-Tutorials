## Measuring Physical Systems

### Position

We start with a static object at a given position. We know _exactly_ where this object is, because we can go ahead and measured it directly.

For this example we'll imagine the position of our object as existing on an $$x, y$$ plane, where $$y$$ is the objects location, and $$x$$ is the _time_ that we measured it. This idea of time is important, because of course we live in real life, and so any given thing only exists in any given position for a finite amount of time.

When measuring the position of our object, we decide where to "origin" is - where our 0 will be.

### Time

Everything occurs over a finite amount of time in our system. Similarly we measure time from some origin, which we decide on. So everything that happens, happens _after_ some arbitrary point in the past that we designate as time 0.

As forces act on our object, it's position changes over time. if we kick a ball, we might see a graph like this:

First the ball goes up, and after a while it comes down.

### Mass

Each object contains a certain amount of matter - what we could call it's _mass_. This is a more fundamental property than it's weight, which depends on how much gravity is a applied to it.

By knowing how _massive_ an object is, how much mass it has, we can calculate how much energy it will take to make some change to the position of that object.

### Force

Nobody is going anywhere unless we can affect some change on the system. _Forces_ are how we do that - they offer some quantifiable change to the _state_ a given object.

#### State

The state of a system, or an object, is the collection of all the information we know about it. 

So, we might say that the state of our cat this that he is _at rest_ - he's sleeping, and going nowhere. The state of a system can be more complex - because systems are collections of multiple objects, there might be a lot of information that describes it's current state. The state of the cat cafe system may also be at rest - all of the cats are sleeping, and nobody is moving.

#### Types of Forces
