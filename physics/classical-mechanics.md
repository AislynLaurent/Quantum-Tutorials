# Classical Mechanics

## Measuring Physical Systems

### Position

We start with a static object at a given position. We know _exactly_ where this object is, because we can go ahead and measured it directly.

For this example we'll imagine the position of our object as existing on an $$x, y$$ plane, where $$y$$ is the objects location, and $$x$$ is the _time_ that we measured it. This idea of time is important, because of course we live in real life, and so any given thing only exists in any given position for a finite amount of time.

When measuring the position of our object, we decide where to "origin" is - whereour 0 will be.

### Time

Everything occurs over a finite amount of time in our system. Similarly we measure time from some origin, which we decide on. So everything that happens, happens _after_ some arbitrary point in the past that we designate as time 0.

As forces act on our object, it's position changes over time. if we kick a ball, we might see a graph like this:
