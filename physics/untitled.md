# Physics Summary

### Classical vs. Quantum Mechanics

To a certain extent, we have an intuitive understanding of classical mechanics. Objects in the real world are affected by forces - measurable ammounts of energy used to do some work.

We understand that in order to pick up a chair, it takes more work than picking up a pen. It's clearly that things that _weigh_ more \(or posses more _mass_\) take more energy to move. The exact nature of these relationships can and have been quantified.

The way that very, very, _very_ small things act isn't like this at all - and it's not intuitive. It is, in fact, super weird. In this chapter we'll cover a basic understanding of exactly how and why it's so weird.
